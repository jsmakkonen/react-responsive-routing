# React - responsive routing

Small app I build to test responsive routing in React.

Renders /dashboard route when using large screen and /albums route when using smaller (mobile) screen.
This app uses React and React DOM version 16 and React Router DOM version 4. SASS is compiled into CSS using node-sass-chokidar.
